		<h1> INTERNSHIP :</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;An internship is a professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a student's field of study or career interest. An internship gives a student the opportunity for &nbsp;career exploration and development, and to learn new skills.</p>
		
		<br>
		<b>TYPES OF INTERNSHIPS :</b>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Insights:</b><br> Many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have "insights" programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Paid Internships:</b><br>Paid internships are common in professional fields including medicine, architecture, science, engineering, law, business , technology, and advertising.Work experience internships usually occur during the second or third year of schooling. This type of internship is to expand an intern's knowledge both in their school studies and also at the company. The intern is expected to bring ideas and knowledge from school into the company.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Work research, virtual research (graduation) or dissertation: </b><br>This is mostly done by students who are in their final year of school. With this kind of internship, a student does research for a particular company. The company can have something that they feel they need to improve, or the student can choose a topic in the company themselves. The results of the research study will be put in a report and often will have to be presented</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Unpaid internships:</b><br> are typically through non-profit charities and think tanks which often have unpaid or volunteer positions. State law and state enforcement agencies may impose requirements on unpaid internship programs under Minimum Wage Act. A program must meet criteria to be properly classified as an unpaid internship. Part of this requirement is proving that the intern is the primary beneficiary of the relationship. Unpaid interns perform work that is not routine and work that company doesn't depend upon</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Partially-paid internships:</b><br> Partially-paid internships is when students are paid in the form of a stipend. Stipends are typically a fixed amount of money that is paid out on a regular basis. Usually, interns that are paid with stipends are paid on a set schedule associated with the organization.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li> <b>Virtual Internship:</b><br> internships that are done remotely on email, phone, and web communication. This offers flexibility as physical presence isn't required. It still provides the capacity to gain job experience without the conventional requirement of being physically present in an office. Virtual interns generally have the opportunity to work at their own pace.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>International Internships:</b><br>International Internships are internships done in a country other than the one that the country of residence. These internships can either be in person or done remotely. Van Mol  analyzed employer perspectives on study abroad versus international internships in 31 European countries, finding that employers value international internships more than international study, while Predovic, Dennis and Jones [13] found that international internships developed cognitive skills like how new information is learned and the motivation to learn.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Returnship :</b><br>Returnship are internships for experienced workers who are looking to return to the workforce after taking time away to care for parents or children.</li>
